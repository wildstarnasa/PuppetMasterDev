Addon for seeing the various attachment points for SetUnit()

The /puppet command without an argument will cycle between 3 states:
1. On - Dots for markers
1. On - Text lables with point's number for markers
1. Off

Supplying an argument after the /puppet command will limit the upper range of SetPoint locations it tries to use.
